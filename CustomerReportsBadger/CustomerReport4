Customer Report Week 4


State of Project: 

The Badger math calculator now has working functionality. 
The calculator can do equations involving single digits. 
Equations involving single digits can be computed with multiplication, addition, subtraction and division. 
The Badger still has working functionality for the text input and very basic random response generator based off of the design. 
A question can be entered in a text field and a button can be pressed to generate a random response that is presented to the user in text. 
There is still no design or functionality for voice input, voice recognition, or audio output. 
The method for a pattern familiarity locator also has yet to be designed or implemented. 
So far, most designs have been implemented at a very basic level including the math calculator. No implementations are developed fully yet.

Development Progress: 

The goals over the past week were to implement the design for the math calculator so it could compute basic equations. 
This goal was accomplished and a user can now enter an equation involving single digits to compute a basic equation involving addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
I saw a working prototype of this new development and it appeared to function as it was intended (Multiplied correctly, divided correctly, subtracted, added) 
The progress that was accomplished over the past week met expectations and fit the development requirement.

Next Week Goals: 

Goals for next week include further development on the random response generator to create a web based interface or similar interface. 
The interface will fit the random response generators needs and will be easy to use.
