Customer Report Week 3


State of Project: 

The Badger now has working functionality for the text input and the random response generator based from the design that was created last week. 
A question can be entered in a text field and a button can be pressed to generated a random response that is presented to the user in text. 
There is no design or functionality for voice input, voice recognition, or audio output. 
The method for a pattern familiarity locator also has yet to be designed or implemented. 
So far, some designs have been implemented and others still need further design before they are ready to start being instituted.

Development Progress: 

The goals over the past week were to implement the design for the text input field and to also implement the design for the random response generator as well. 
These goals were accomplished and a user can now enter their question and receive a random response. 
The progress that was accomplished over the past week was on par with what was expected of them and met the development requirement.

Next Week Goals: 

Goals for next week include designing and implementing a math like calculator that will take mathematical input equations and will return correct answers. 
Once the input is entered, a button will be pressed which will take the equation input and correctly interpret what action needs to be done in order to generate the appropriate output. 
The output that is generated from interpretation should never be random and should always return a correct response when using this calculator function.
