State of Project:

Calculating multiple digits and numbers with the math calculator brings success. 
Basic Math mode solves equations between two numbers using most types
of operators including addition, multiplication, division and subtraction. The Badger 
continues to function for the text input and basic random response generator for 8 
ball mode and trivia mode and many answers are available. The interface is in a good
state of completeness and new implementations do it good. No Design for functionality for
voice input, voice recognition, or audio output and isn't expected. The method for a pattern 
familiarity locator is still a possibility doesn't appear to be a  reachable goal. 
Different types of feature inputs have been added such as a radio button. 
There are multiple different modes of operation that all do specific tasks for the user.

Development Progress:

The goals over the past week were to finish the instruction manual. The instructions
for basic math mode is being finished up. The Basic math calculator still needs instructions 
added. Resolving any errors with the current prototype of fixed and the product runs
smoothly enough. Most of the functionality for radio buttons and other input type features 
appear to work. More progress is encourages in these areas as well of others. The 
requirements satisfactory this week. Developments meet expectations with satisfactory level.

Goals for next week:

Goals for next week include finishing up any last changes or updates to the 
project such as tweaking input features and look of interface and finishing up
any unfinished past goals that may need or could use some extra work. Starting a
completely new goal may not be able to be fully accomplished but one could try 
to start one. Anything that may comliment the final product as a whole or create
a more attractive interface which is easy to use.
