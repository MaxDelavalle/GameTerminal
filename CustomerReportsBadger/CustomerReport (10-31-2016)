State of Project:

The Badger math calculator is still working with multiple digits. 
It solves equations between two numbers using all types of operators
including addition, multiplication, division and subtraction.
The Badger continues to function for the text input and basic random 
response generator based off of the design. The web app part of this interface 
is working and constantly undergoing changes. No design for functionality for voice 
input, voice recognition, or audio output as of yet. The method for a pattern familiarity 
locator may or may not happen as a future goal. Implementations have been 
added such as The Badger asking trivia questions.

Development Progress:

The goals over the past week were to get three digits working with the calculator.
This has been put off for later because more focus was given to other
creative areas. Over the past week, trivia question were added to The Badger. 
The Badger will ask you a trivia question and you will have to answer it in your head. 
The interface was updated to accommodate these questions being asked.

Next Week Goals:

Goals for next week include adding 17 answers to the trivia questions that are asked, 
so the user has access to the correct answers. Another goal is to work on 
the style of the generator to make it look good with the new developments. 
Another goal is to get the calculator working with 3 numbers. The last goal is a 
two week goal and is not expected to be done by next week.
