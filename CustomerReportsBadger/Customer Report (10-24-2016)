Customer Report Week 8
	
     State of Project:
	
        The Badger math calculator is now working with multiple digits. It solves equations between only two numbers using all types of operators
  	including addition, multiplication, division and subtraction.
	The Badger still has working functionality for the text input and basic random response generator based off of the design. 
  	The web app part of this interface is working and has a unique interface.
	There is still no design or functionality for voice input, voice recognition, or audio output.
	The method for a pattern familiarity locator is a future design goal.
 	 Implementations that were once working are now working again and better than ever. Things are in better shape than they were
  	last week and are coming along well.
	
	Development Progress:
	
	The goals over the past week were to get two digits working with the calculator.
	This was accomplished. More than 2 digits also works and correclty caclulates. Although you can use numbers with more
 	than 2 digits, you can only do an equation with 2 seperate numbers. For examples, you could do 9000 - 10 = 8990, 
  	but you could not do 90 + 10000 + 72 because that is three seperate numbers. The design for the calculator was
  	also updated making the design more aesthetically pleasing, adding different colors and button appearance.
  	The progress that was accomplished over the past week met expectations and requirements.
	
	Next Week Goals:
	
	Goals for next week include calculating an equation with more than two numbers involved, such as 10 + 300 + 56.
	Another goal is to work on the design and implementation of the math calculator so they look good together and compliment each other
  	in style.
