Customer Report 12

State of Project:

Whem calculating multiple digits and numbers with the math calculator success 
is achieved. Basic Math mode solves equations between two numbers using most types
of operators including addition, multiplication, division and subtraction. The Badger 
continues to function for the text input and basic random response generator for 8 
ball mode and trivia mode and many answers are available. The interface i in a good
state of completeness and extra designs do it good. No Design for functionality for
voice input, voice recognition, or audio output yet. The method for a pattern 
familiarity locator is still a possibility. Different types of feature inputs 
have been added such as a radio button. There are multiple different modes of 
operation that all do specific tasks for the user.

Development Progress:

The goals over the past week were to finish the instruction manual. This 
wasn't completed fully. The Basic math calculator still needs instructions 
added. However, the other goal of fixing problems with radio buttons and 
feature input errors are pretty much resolved. Most of the functionality for
radio buttons and other input type features appear to work. More progress can
be made in these areas though. The requirements were almost fulfilled this week.
Developments were just under satifactory levels.

Goals for next week:

Goals for next week include finishing The Badger instruction manual which would
include adding instructions for the Basic Math Mode. Another goal is to get
all the user features and inputs features working correctly. Over the next couple
of weeks the final touches to the project should be coming together.
