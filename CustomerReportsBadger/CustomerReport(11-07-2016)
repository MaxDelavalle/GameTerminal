Customer Report 10

State of Project:

The Badger math calculator continues to work with multiple digits. 
It still solves equations between two numbers using all types of operators
including addition, multiplication, division and subtraction.
The Badger continues to function for the text input and basic random 
response generator based off of the previous design. The web app part of this interface 
is working and constantly undergoing changes. No design for functionality for voice 
input, voice recognition, or audio output as of yet. The method for a pattern familiarity 
locator may or may not happen as a future goal. Implementations have been 
added such as The Badger asking trivia questions. The Badger now answers the
questions that are asked by the Badger.

Development Progress:

The goals over the past week were to get three digits working with the calculator. This
goal is still being worked on and is very close to completion.
It is important that this is not rushed because it is important that this function
does not contain bugs. Another goal was to create answers to the trivia questions that were
asked;This goal was accomplished. Over the past week, trivia questions along with their
corresponding answers were added to The Badger. There is a question that is asked, and once you click a button
it will respond by giving you an answer to the question. The interface was updated to 
accommodate these questions being answered. The answers display accordingly in an appropriate
area.

Hypothetical Next Week Goals:

Goals for next week include adding more answers and questions to The Badger to 
make it more complete. Another goal is to work on math calculator and get it working
with the 3 different numbers. The last goal is to move the design changes made outside 
the mobile app to the mobile app.
