Customer Report Week 6

State of Project: 

The Badger math calculator has been fixed and is working again with single digits and minimally with two digit equations. 
The calculator can now do equations again. 
Equations involving single digits are computed involving multiplication, addition, subtraction and division. 
This was not working last week but now shows an improvement in functionality.
The Badger still has working functionality for the text input and basic random response generator based off of the design. 
The interface for this functionality is improved since last week. 
There is still no design or functionality for voice input, voice recognition, or audio output. 
The method for a pattern familiarity locator is soon to be in the works. 
The Badger IOS code for the random response generator is still working the same.
Implementations that were once working are now working again. 
The Implementing is in better shape than last week, with more functionality.

Development Progress: 

The goals over the past week were to fix the single digit math calculator so it is functioning properly again. 
This goal was accomplished and single digits now do basic equations correctly again as they used to. 
The other goal was to get the math calculator working with two digits. 
This wasn't fully accomplished and it only computes very basic or specific equations with two digits. 
The other goal of making the web app random generator more visually appealing was accomplished and there is now a user interface that is more accomplished. 
The progress that was accomplished over the past week met most expectations and the development requirement was satisfied.

Next Week Goals: 

Goals for next week include getting two digit numbers to work better with a variety of different equations instead of only a few selected equations. 
Another goal is to formulate a very basic design for how the pattern locator will function.
