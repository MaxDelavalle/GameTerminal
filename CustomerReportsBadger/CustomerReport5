Customer Report Week 5


State of Project: 

The Badger now has working IOS code for the random response generator. 
The Badger math calculator is not working anymore with single digits and needs to be fixed. 
The calculator can no longer do equations. Equations involving single digits should be computed with multiplication, addition, subtraction and division. 
This was working last week but now contains errors that need to be corrected. 
The Badger still has working functionality for the text input and basic random response generator based off of the design. 
The interface for this functionality is in better shape. 
There is still no design or functionality for voice input, voice recognition, or audio output. 
The method for a pattern familiarity locator also has yet to be designed or implemented. 
Some implementations that were once working are now non-functional. The Implementing process needs more work.

Development Progress: 

The goals over the past week were further develop the web app interface for the random response generator and to get the random response generator working in for IOS. 
The code for the IOS now generates a random response. 
The other goal was mostly accomplished and a basic interface is now in the works. 
The progress that was accomplished over the past week nearly met expectations and the development requirement.

Next Week Goals: 

Goals for next week include fixing the math calculator so It once again works with single digit numbers to compute equations involving, addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division. 
Another goal is to get the math calculator working with 2 digits to also be able to compute equations involving the basic operations. 
The last goal is to further build upon the web app interface to make it more user friendly and visually appealing.
