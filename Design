Project Plan:


Dream: Our long-term plan for the project is to create a game terminal which is comprised of 
       multiple games. Any amount of games can be added to this, from arcade games to classic 
       card games. We dream that this terminal could become a “Game Hub” which could contain 
       hundreds of games, including games created by the game terminal creators, to user 
       created games. This “terminal” will include a section where Registered Members can submit
       working source code to a game that they would like to see added to Game Terminal. This 
       will then be reviewed by the Game Terminal creators, and pending approval, be added to Game Terminal.


September Goals: 
    -Design Game Terminal
    -Create working Game Terminal
    Terminal must support:
        -Multiple Games (pops up in new window)
